      "{'text': 'Biology is the scientific study of life.[1][2][3] It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field.[1][2][3] For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations. Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life.[1][2][3] Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce.[1][2][3] Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.[1][2][3][4][5]\\n\\nBiologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization,[1] from the molecular biology of a cell to the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations.[1][6] Hence, there are multiple subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they use.[7][8][9] Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions, generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them.[1]\\n\\nLife on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago,[10] is immensely diverse. Biologists have sought to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. These various organisms contribute to the biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through their biophysical environment.', 'number': 3, 'subject': 'biology', 'tone': 'simple', 'response_json': '{\"1\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"2\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}, \"3\": {\"mcq\": \"multiple choice question\", \"options\": {\"a\": \"choice here\", \"b\": \"choice here\", \"c\": \"choice here\", \"d\": \"choice here\"}, \"correct\": \"correct answer\"}}', 'quiz': '### RESPONSE_JSON\\n{\\n\"1\": {\\n\"mcq\": \"Which branch of science deals with the study of life?\",\\n\"options\": {\\n\"a\": \"Physics\",\\n\"b\": \"Chemistry\",\\n\"c\": \"Biology\",\\n\"d\": \"Mathematics\"\\n},\\n\"correct\": \"c\"\\n},\\n\"2\": {\\n\"mcq\": \"Which of the following is a major theme in the study of biology?\",\\n\"options\": {\\n\"a\": \"The study of inanimate objects\",\\n\"b\": \"The study of the universe\",\\n\"c\": \"The study of the structure and function of cells and organisms, and the relationships between organisms and their environment\",\\n\"d\": \"The study of numbers and shapes\"\\n},\\n\"correct\": \"c\"\\n},\\n\"3\": {\\n\"mcq\": \"Which of the following is NOT a major theme in the study of biology?\",\\n\"options\": {\\n\"a\": \"The study of energy processing in organisms\",\\n\"b\": \"The study of heredity and genetics\",\\n\"c\": \"The study of the structure and function of cells and organisms, and the relationships between organisms and their environment\",\\n\"d\": \"The study of the cycling of nutrients and energy through ecosystems\"\\n},\\n\"correct\": \"d\"\\n}\\n}', 'review': '### RESPONSE_JSON\\n{\\n\"1\": {\\n\"mcq\": \"Which branch of science deals with the study of life?\",\\n\"options\": {\\n\"a\": \"Physics\",\\n\"b\": \"Chemistry\",\\n\"c\": \"Biology\",\\n\"d\": \"Mathematics\"\\n},\\n\"correct\": \"c\"\\n},\\n\"2\": {\\n\"mcq\": \"Which of the following is a major theme in the study of biology?\",\\n\"options\": {\\n\"a\": \"The study of inanimate objects\",\\n\"b\": \"The study of the universe\",\\n\"c\": \"The study of the structure and function of cells and organisms, and the relationships between organisms and their environment\",\\n\"d\": \"The study of numbers and shapes\"\\n},\\n\"correct\": \"c\"\\n},\\n\"3\": {\\n\"mcq\": \"Which of the following is NOT a major theme in the study of biology?\",\\n\"options\": {\\n\"a\": \"The study of energy processing in organisms\",\\n\"b\": \"The study of heredity and genetics\",\\n\"c\": \"The study of the structure and function of cells and organisms, and the relationships between organisms and their environment\",\\n\"d\": \"The study of the cycling of nutrients and energy through ecosystems\"\\n},\\n\"correct\": \"d\"\\n}\\n}'}\n"
